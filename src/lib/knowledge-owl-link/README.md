# knowledge-owl-link

The Knowledge owl links are native `<button>` or `<a>` elements with help article.

Native `<button>` or `<a>` elements are always used in order to provide the most straightforward and accessible experience for users.
A `<button>` element should be used whenever some action is performed. An `<a>` element should be used whenever the user will navigate to another view.

There are several `<button>` variants, each applied as an attribute:

| **Name**               | **Description**                              |
